# BookTracker

## About Me:
A fan of anime, and started collecting light novels (novels of anime) and some manga. Have about 40 of them at home and wanted to create my own database of my books to display them onto an app. This is also another fun way to improve my coding skills.

## Disclaimer:
This app is made with the purpose to track my light novels and for educational purposes. It is not created to be able to read light novels by scraping from other hosting sites. This is still a work in progress.

For visual look of the app, please go to the "Clips and Images" folder. Download "clip-3" which is the latest overview of the app. Click "view raw" and it will prompt you to download.
